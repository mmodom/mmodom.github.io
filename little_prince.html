	As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span> <span1>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span1>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span2>	"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..." <span2>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span2>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." </span2>And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself  were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>

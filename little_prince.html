	As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
	 <span class="underlined">
	I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. 
</span> 
	<span class="orange">
	It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
</span>
	In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
	<span class="red">
		"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..." 
	</span>
			As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
			 <span class="red">
			"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
			 </span>
			And I felt him to be more fragile still.
			 <span class="underlined">
			I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself  were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
